Switches **from Access Policies → RBAC model**, which:
- Is more flexible
- Integrates better with Terraform, ADF, Synapse, AKS

## ✅ Summary: Why You're Creating It 

- It's foundational: every secure system needs a secrets manager  
- Later modules (Storage, Synapse, ADF, AKS) will **depend on it**  IMPORTANT
- You'll **store sensitive data** like passwords, keys, and connection strings here 
- You'll **add secrets and keys to it dynamically or manually**, e.g.:

```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name kv-securebridge --name "synapse-sql-auth" --value "<password>"
